                    Global Illumination and Rendering (TNCG15) at Link√∂ping University and the aim was to create 
                    a functional ray tracer that could handle difficult lightning.</i></p>
                    
                <p className="project-text">The Monte Carlo ray tracer is based on the Whitted ray tracer, with perfect 
                    reflection and refraction, with the addition that it can create effects such as colour bleed and caustics. 
                    A photon mapping method was added to the ray tracer, which creates softer shadows and better caustics.</p>

                <p className="project-text">In Monte Carlo ray tracing, integrals are solved using the Monte Carlo integration 
                    and random sampling. The rendering equation presented by Kajiya et al, in The Rendering Equation, is the 
                    foundation of the Monte Carlo ray tracing implementation and describes how to calculate the light intensity 
                    at any point on a surface within a scene.</p>

                <p className="project-text">When rendering a scene in 3D, an image is created where the screen pixels are filled
                    with colour intensity values computed with rays. These values correspond to those given when looking at the scene, 
                    from the camera, through a pixel plane. The camera has a given position, where it is located, as well as a point 
                    to look at. The normalised difference between these two points gives the viewing direction of the camera. 
                    The main purpose of the camera is to set the origin of the traced rays, which all go through the view plane, 
                    representing the screen pixels. </p>

                <p className="project-text">To view the scene, it must contain one or more light sources as well as objects, 
                    or surfaces, that the light rays can intersect with. These objects can be implicit objects or shapes described 
                    as polygonal meshes. Each object has a position in the scene, relative to the world coordinate system, and a 
                    given specific material property.</p>

                <p className="project-text">The rendered scene used in this project contained a box-shaped room, more specifically 
                    a Cornell box. The room contained various objects such as implicit spheres and polygon meshes. This ray tracer uses 
                    three different types of rays; shadow rays, reflected rays and refracted rays.</p>
